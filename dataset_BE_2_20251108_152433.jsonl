Purchaser Name: HOEGAARDEN. Summary: Civil Affairs Software. Description: Object of these services: Civil affairs software. Explanation: The Hoegaarden municipal council is reviewing the current software landscape surrounding its civil affairs and reception department (population, civil registry and immigration affairs). Currently the service worked in different applications from different suppliers. This has a number of limitations: • files are becoming more complex and family members are increasingly registered in different registers and have different questions at the same time (such as an application for permanent residence in Belgium, simultaneously with an application for Belgian nationality); • employees who take on different roles within the cell must regularly switch to a different working environment; • the learning curve for new employees is unnecessarily high because they have to get to know multiple applications; • a more flexible work organization within the service is more difficult to achieve; • cost-effectiveness, including in terms of connections to be made. Therefore wishes the board to receive one total quotation for the following modules: • Population, including digital housing control; • Foreigners; • Civil status.
